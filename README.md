# Lucid SF CI/CD demo

This is a demo project to learn about CI/CD in the Salesforce Environment. 

## The plan to deploy changes

I shall be using the Org development model, as it is what I am most familiar with.

I have 3 orgs: LucidSF_Prod, LucidSF_Integration and LucidSF_Develop.

These are all developer edition orgs, but will mimic the Production, Integration and Development environments respectively.

The repo has been initialized from a freshly minted org, and will be tracking mostly Apex class files, Flows, Flexipages, Objects and LWC components.

## Steps to reproduce:

The steps can be found [here](./STEPS.md)
